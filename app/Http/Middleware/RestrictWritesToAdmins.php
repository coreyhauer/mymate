 * App-wide read-only tier. A normal operator may *view* the whole console but
 * may not change anything. The app first shipped a single tier where every logged-in operator
 * could edit, and only the user-management endpoints were gated. This closes the rest:
 * any state-changing request (non-safe HTTP method) from a non-admin is refused with 403,
 * so a viewer cannot delete a device, drop a link, run a scan, trigger an upgrade, etc.,
 * regardless of whether the UI still shows the control.
 *
 * Runs after `auth:sanctum`, so `user()` is present. Admins bypass entirely. The only
 * writes a non-admin keeps are changing *their own* password (a self-service action, not
 * a change to the monitored fleet) and the OPERATOR_ACTION_ROUTES below (harmless writes
 * that never touch the fleet's config either).
