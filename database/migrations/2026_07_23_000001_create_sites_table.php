/**
 * Sites: the physical locations gear lives at - a tower, a fiber cabinet, a POP, an exchange.
 *
 * Geo mode (GitHub #11) pins each device individually, which is fine for a handful of routers
 * but does not survive a real access network: an operator with a few thousand devices spread
 * over a few hundred towers does not want to drag a thousand pins, and the coordinates they
 * already trust live in their OSS/inventory, not here. A site carries the coordinates once and
 * every device at it inherits them, so placing a whole tower's worth of gear is one row.
 *
 * `external_ref` is the id this site has in whatever system owns the truth (UISP, Sonar, a
 * spreadsheet). It's the idempotency key for re-imports - re-running an import updates in
 * place instead of duplicating, so the source of truth can be re-synced on a schedule.
