 * Backhaul links between two sites - the physical topology of what connects to what.
 *
 * Unlike the interface-level device links (which need both ends polled), these are site-to-site
 * and imported from the OSS that actually knows the backbone (UISP's data_link, Sonar, etc.),
 * so the geo map can draw the real tower-to-tower backhauls instead of inferring them from
 * device links between possibly-misplaced devices. `external_ref` makes an import idempotent.
